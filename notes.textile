Resolve "can't find module buster" - npm install buster
For strict mode need to wrap stuff in closures
  - Need to help buster find globals inside this
  - Good pattern from Morgan for node/browser tests
  - var FOO = global.foo || require(path/to/foo);
    - where global is a named parameter and the correct scope is passed in to it: (function(global){{}(this));
Linting can be temperamental to setup
 - If getting errors more likely in the test code than your code
 - Should lint your test files too - part of production codebase
 - linting is part of tests, not a separate activity.

# Buster tests have the following format:
# "STRING": function () { asserts... }
# Use string operand to run one tests
#   e.g. buster test "foo"
#   note: treated as a RegExp for fuzzy matching
#   Only works for individual tests, not test cases
# Use -g flag to specify group
#   e.g. buster test -g "Node"
# Use -t flag to specify test files to run
#   e.g. buster test --tests test/mytest.js
#   Typically have ONE TestCase per file

Stuff to try with buster in skeleton repo

- Y: TDD styles tests
- Y: BDD styles tests
- Assertion Count
- Async Objects
- Mocking/Stubs
- AMD Architectures
- Y: Buster lint
- Buster coverage
- Git pre-commit hook to run tests across whole codebase?

TODO: Auto semantic version? How/when?
