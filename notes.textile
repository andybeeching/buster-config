Resolve "can't find module buster" - npm install buster
For strict mode need to wrap stuff in closures
  - Need to help buster find globals inside this
  - Good pattern from Morgan for node/browser tests
  - var FOO = global.foo || require(path/to/foo);
    - where global is a named parameter and the correct scope is passed in to it: (function(global){{}(this));
Linting can be temperamental to setup
 - If getting errors more likely in the test code than your code
 - Should lint your test files too - part of production codebase
 - linting is part of tests, not a separate activity.


Stuff to try with buster in skeleton repo

- Unit styles tests
- BDD styles tests
- Async Objects
- Mocking/Stubs
- AMD Architectures
- Y: Buster lint
- Buster coverage
- Git pre-commit hook to run tests across whole codebase?
